# Edge_detection_image_processing
Edge detection and basic image processing tasks using MATLAB.
Task 1:
Write a program to contrast adjust the same image. The contrast adjustment operation involves rescaling the input image pixels with values in the range [Amin, Amax] at different pre-defined ranges. Amin and Amax are the minimum and maximum gray scale in your input image. Compare and contrast at least two different methods to change contrast for this image.

Task 2:
Write a program capable of zooming and shrinking an image with and without bilinear interpolation methods using four nearest neighbors of a point (see the section in your text). The input to your function is the desired size of the resulting image in the horizontal and vertical direction. Use your program to shrink this image from 512x512 to 16 x 16 pixels and then zoom
the image back to 512 x 512. You must take care of the boundary image pixels appropriately (this
may be done in different ways).
Task 3:
Download the Clown image from image processing course web page. Select a subimage of size 32x32 from this image. Convert this image to binary by appropriate thresholding. Now, apply chain code technique to extract edges of this binary image. Experiment with different methods and comment on the code performance (i.e., time taken on a type of processor).
